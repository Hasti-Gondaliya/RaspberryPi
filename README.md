# What is BLE?
BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy, which is a wireless communication technology designed for short-range communication between devices. It is a power-efficient version of the classic Bluetooth technology and is commonly used in various applications such as IoT (Internet of Things), wearables, healthcare devices, and smart home automation.

BLE is specifically designed for low-power devices that require long battery life, making it ideal for applications where energy efficiency is crucial. It operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band and offers lower data transfer rates compared to classic Bluetooth. However, its low power consumption enables devices to operate for extended periods without frequent battery replacements.
